                    	<p>
                        	The transportation of fly ash is a more regulated and strict process than many may think. There are speculated risks regarding exposure to the ash, but nothing has been proved. For the most part, large amounts of fly ash only pose a serious threat to the environment. Improperly handled ash can contaminate ground water sources and drainage ways. Additionally, high lime content present in fly ash can cause a reaction when exposed to large enough quantities of water. Exposure to the resulting fumes can cause lung and respiratory irritation.

                    <div class="col-md-12">
                    	<p>
                        	Itâ€™s for these reasons that fly ash must be transported to end-user recycling or dump areas with safety in mind. By hiring a team with the know-how and equipment to get the job done, you can avoid costly remediation fines in the event of an accident.

                    	<p>
                        	Setting out or ground tracing is the process of laying down the excavation lines and center lines etc. on the ground before the excavation is started. The center line of the longest outer wall of the building is marked on the ground by stretching a string between wooden or mild steel pegs. Each peg may be projected about 25 to 50 mm form the ground level and 2m from the edge of the excavation. The boundary is marked with the lime powder. The center lines of other walls are marked perpendicular to the longer walls.

                    	<p>
                        	Coal can be transported from mines and processing plants to consumers in several different ways:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conveyors, trams, and trucks move coal around mines and short distances from the mines for loading onto other modes of long-distance transportation.</li>
                            <li>Trains transport nearly 70% of coal deliveries in the United States for at least part of the way from mines to consumers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                    	<ul>
                            <li>Barges transport coal on rivers and lakes.</li>
                            <li>Ships transport coal on the Great Lakes and the oceans to consumers in the United States and other countries.</li>
                            <li>Slurry pipelines move mixtures of crushed coal and water. This method is not currently in use in the United States.</li>
                        </ul>
                    	<p>
                        	Transporting coal can be more expensive than the cost of mining coal. Some coal consumers, such as coal-fired electric power plants, are near coal mines to lower transportation costs.
